# AWS CloudWatch

## What is AWS CloudWatch?

AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services that gives you visibility into your cloud resources and applications. It collects and tracks metrics, monitors log files, sets alarms, and automatically reacts to changes in your AWS resources

## Core Components of CloudWatch

### CloudWatch Metrics

CloudWatch Metrics is the fundamental monitoring service that collects data points about your resources and applications. It automatically collects metrics from many AWS services

<br>

Key features of CloudWatch Metrics include:
- Built-in metrics are automatically collected for most AWS services
- Custom metrics can be defined and published for your applications
- Metrics are retained for 15 months by default
- Metrics can be used to trigger alarms or create dashboards


### CloudWatch Logs

CloudWatch Logs helps you centralize logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services. With CloudWatch Logs, you can monitor, store, and access your log files in one place

<br>

Key features:
- Log groups organize logs by application, resource, or category
- Log streams represent instances of an application or resource
- Log retention policies allow you to control how long logs are kept
- Log insights allow you to query your logs with a powerful query language


### CloudWatch Alarms

CloudWatch Alarms allow you to watch metrics and automatically trigger actions based on predefined thresholds. You can set up alarms to notify you or take automated actions when a metric breaches your specified threshold.

<br>

Key features:
- Alarm states: OK, ALARM, INSUFFICIENT_DATA
- Actions can be triggered when alarms change state
- Alarms can be based on static thresholds or anomaly detection
- Composite alarms combine multiple alarms with AND/OR logic


### CloudWatch Dashboards

CloudWatch Dashboards are customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single view.

<br>

Key features of CloudWatch Dashboards include:
- Cross-region dashboards for global applications
- Dashboard sharing for team collaboration
- Widgets can display metrics, logs, and other AWS resource data
- Customizable layouts and time ranges


### CloudWatch Events / EventBridge

CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources.

<br>

Key features of CloudWatch Events include:
- Event rules match incoming events and route them to targets
- Targets include Lambda functions, SNS topics, SQS queues, and more
- Scheduled events can be used to trigger actions at specific times
- Event buses can receive events from your applications or third-party services


## Business Benefits of CloudWatch

### Comprehensive Monitoring
- End-to-end visibility across your entire AWS infrastructure and applications
- Single pane of glass for metrics, logs, and events
- Correlation of data across different resources and services
- Integration with AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing

### Operational benefits
- Real-time monitoring and alerting helps identify issues quickly
- Automated actions reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Historical data analysis helps identify trends and optimize resources
- Compliance with audit and regulatory requirements through logs retention

### Cost Optimization
- Resource utilization insights help identify over-provisioned resources
- Alerts on unusual spending patterns
- Rightsizing recommendations based on performance metrics
- Only pay for what you use with granular pricing

### Improved Application Performance
- Detailed performance metrics help identify bottlenecks
- Anomaly detection highlights unusual behavior
- Custom metrics allow monitoring of business-specific KPIs
- Proactive alerts before issues impact users
