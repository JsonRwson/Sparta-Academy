# Reverse Proxy

## What is a Reverse Proxy?
A **reverse proxy** is a server that sits in front of a web server and handles client requests on its behalf. Instead of clients (users) directly communicating with the web server, they send requests to the reverse proxy, which then forwards them to the appropriate web server.

This setup ensures that the web server remains hidden from direct client access.

## Benefits of Using a Reverse Proxy

### 1. Load Balancing
A reverse proxy can distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers, ensuring that no single server becomes overloaded. This is especially useful for high-traffic websites that receive millions of requests.

- Prevents a single server from becoming slow, unresponsive, or crashing.
- If one server fails, the reverse proxy redirects traffic to the remaining healthy servers, maintaining uptime and performance.

### 2. Security Enhancement
By sitting in front of a web server, a reverse proxy shields the backend server's IP address from being exposed to the public.

- This makes it harder for attackers to target the backend server directly.
- It can help block malicious requests and provide an additional layer of protection against threats such as **DDoS attacks**.

### 3. Caching for Faster Performance
A reverse proxy can cache content, meaning that frequently requested web pages or resources can be stored temporarily.

- Reduces the number of requests reaching the backend server, improving response times.
- Enhances user experience by serving cached content instantly instead of regenerating it every time.

### 4. SSL/TLS Encryption Offloading
Handling SSL/TLS encryption is computationally expensive for web servers. A reverse proxy can take over this task by:

- Encrypting and decrypting all HTTPS traffic, freeing up resources on the backend server.
- Ensuring secure communication between users and the website while optimizing performance.

## What is a Forward Proxy?
While a **reverse proxy** protects and manages traffic to web servers, a **forward proxy** operates on behalf of clients (users).

A **forward proxy** sits between a client and the internet, ensuring that no origin server directly communicates with the client.

### Benefits of a Forward Proxy
- **Hides the client's IP address**, making browsing more private and anonymous.
- **Blocks access to malicious or restricted websites**, improving security.
- **Bypasses geographic restrictions**, allowing users to access region-locked content.
- **Helps organizations monitor and control web traffic**, enabling admins to track network activity.
- **Caches frequently accessed content**, reducing response times and bandwidth usage.
