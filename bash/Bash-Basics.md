## What is BASH?

**BASH** = **Bourne Again Shell**  
A command-line shell and scripting language for Unix/Linux systems.

## What is a Kernel
  The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. It manages the following resources of the Linux system:

  - File management
  - Process management
  - I/O management
  - Memory management
  - Device management etc.

## What is a shell
  A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand.

### Key Concepts:
- **Linux does not care about file extensions**  
  - Renaming `cat.jpg` to `cat.txt` does not change its actual type.
- **Case Sensitivity Matters**  
  - `FILE.txt` and `file.txt` are different files.
- **Tab Autocomplete**  
  - Press `Tab` while typing a command or filename to auto-fill it.
- **Pipes (`|`)**  
  - Used to pass output from one command to another.

## User & System Information Commands

| Command       | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `whoami`      | Displays the current username                     |
| `uname`       | Shows system information                          |
| `history`     | Displays all commands run in this session         |
| `history -c`  | Clears command history                            |
| `!<id>`       | Runs a previously used command from history       |

| `pwd`         | Prints the present working directory              |

## Root & User Management

- **`root`** = Superuser with all system privileges.
- **To run a command with elevated privileges:**  
  ```bash
  sudo <command>
  ```
- **Switch user:**  
  ```bash
  sudo su <username>
  ```
  - Running `sudo su` without a username switches to root.
